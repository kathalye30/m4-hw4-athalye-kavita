                        <h2>About</h2>
                                <p>Miley Cyrus first gained fame by starring in as the main character in Hannah Montana, a Disney Channel series about a high school girl living a double life as teen pop sensation. As concert performances and album production were main themes of the show, Cyrus herself recorded numerous songs for each season of Hannah Montana that were released as their own albums. Cyrus did the Hannah Montana Tour in 2007-2008, and later starred in Hannah Montana: The Movie in 2009. As she neared the end of her Disney Channel contract, Cyrus explored new forms of music and expression, which often led to controversial backlash from the media. However, her public exploration of her art and bold subject choices are what made her standout from her peers at the time, including Selena Gomez and Taylor Swift.</p>
